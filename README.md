# Astral
Astral is a 64 bit operating system for the x86-64 architecture written in C.

It's early in its development and is not production ready.

## Building

You will need an x86-64-elf-gcc cross compiler and nasm.

To build the kernel run ``make``
To build the iso run ``make sysdisk.iso``

## Testing

There is a make target to run Astral under qemu with kvm. Run ``make test``
